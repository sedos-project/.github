In the SEDOS project data is collected, preprocessed and published by work packages (WPs) 4 to 8. Therefore, partners working in WPs 4-8 create multiple input data datapackages and upload them to the OEP via the OEDatamodel-API. By applying the descirbed data architecture, we follow the frictionless data conventions. Everytime new data is uploaded to the OEP, the partners also have to register the new data version on the databus via the OEDatamodel-API. By this process, the latest versions from all WPs are available on the databus in order to be further processed by the SEDOS pipeline. Input datapackages generated and published by WP 4-8 will be automatically checked for updates and processed to one datapackage holding all input data by the SEDOS Data Pipeline. This input datapackage will also be published on the OEP. The partners in WP9 will then download the input datapackage from the OEP and use it to set up, parameterize and solve their energy system model. The modelling results will be postprocessed and uploaded to the OEP by the partners of WP9. A generalized representation of a datapackage is shown in the figure below.

In SEDOS we use the oemetadata v.1.5.1 (OEM) as metadata standard. For more context about the OEM-keys in oemetadata v.1.5.1, see here . In energy systems modelling, data is fed into a model via parameters and their associated values. In the following, when we speak about ontological annotation, we, therefore, speak of parameter names, which are linked to an ontological concept for definition. The linkage of parameter name and ontological concept in OEM has three elements: user-defined parameter name human-readable ontological concept name Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) Below the general section of the oemetadata v1.5.1 is shown, relevant for the ontological annotation of the table content itself . The general content of the table is annotated in the subject key { \"name\": null, \"title\": null, \"id\": null, \"description\": null, \"language\": [ null ], \"subject\": [ { \"name\": null, \"path\": null } ], \"keywords\": [ null ], \"publicationDate\": null } Below the resource section of the oemetadata v1.5.1 is shown, relevant for ontological annotation of parameter names . Link a parameter name to a suitable ontology concept Background know-how Parameters can occur in the column header or as column value when dealing with tabular data. A) Parameters in the column headers are annotated in the isAbout key. B) Parameters occurring within a column are annotated in the valueReference key. { \"resources\": [ { \"profile\": null, \"name\": null, \"path\": null, \"format\": null, \"encoding\": null, \"schema\": { \"fields\": [ { \"name\": null, \"description\": null, \"type\": null, \"unit\": null, \"isAbout\": [ { \"name\": null, \"path\": null } ], \"valueReference\": [ { \"value\": null, \"name\": null, \"path\": null } ] } ] } } ] } A) Parameters in the column headers - using isAbout : user-defined parameter name is put in name (OEM-key 15.6.1.1), a suitable human-readable ontological concept name is put in name (OEM-key 15.6.1.5.1), Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) is put in path (OEM-key 15.6.1.5.2) For example: A column with values for the rotor diameter of a wind turbine: id wind_turbine ro_diam 1 type A 50 2 type A 60 3 type A 70 4 type B 80 5 type B 110 { \"resources\": [ { \"profile\": null, \"name\": null, \"path\": null, \"format\": null, \"encoding\": null, \"schema\": { \"fields\": [ { \"name\": \"wind_turbine\", \"description\": null, \"type\": null, \"unit\": null, \"isAbout\": [ { \"name\": \"wind energy converting unit\", \"path\": \"http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00000044\" } ], \"valueReference\": [ { \"value\": null, \"name\": null, \"path\": null } ] }, { \"name\": \"ro_diam\", \"description\": null, \"type\": null, \"unit\": \"meter\", \"isAbout\": [ { \"name\": \"rotor diameter\", \"path\": \"http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00020144\" } ], \"valueReference\": [ { \"value\": null, \"name\": null, \"path\": null } ] } ] } } ] } B) Parameters within a column - using valueReference and isAbout : valueReference user-defined parameter name is put in value (OEM-key 15.6.1.6.1), a suitable human-readable ontological concept name is put in name (OEM-key 15.6.1.6.2), Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) is put in path (OEM-key 15.6.1.6.3) isAbout When annotating using valueReference , don't forget to annotate the column itself in isAbout , as described in A). For example: A column containing various types of fuels: id various_types_of_energy_carriers 1 coal_HCV 2 green_diesel 3 coal_LCV { \"resources\": [ { \"profile\": null, \"name\": null, \"path\": null, \"format\": null, \"encoding\": null, \"schema\": { \"fields\": [ { \"name\": \"various_types_of_energy_carriers\", \"description\": null, \"type\": null, \"unit\": null, \"isAbout\": [ { \"name\": \"portion of matter\", \"path\": \"http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00000331\" } ], \"valueReference\": [ { \"value\": \"coal_HCV\", \"name\": \"anthracite\", \"path\": \"http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00000058\" }, { \"value\": \"green_diesel\", \"name\": \"biodiesel\", \"path\": \"http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00000071\" }, { \"value\": \"coal_LCV\", \"name\": \"lignite\", \"path\": \"http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00000251\" } ] } ] } } ] } With oemetadata builder Annotation conventions for automatic data processing In SEDOS, automatic data reasoning and processing are based mainly on ontological annotations in the metadata. Thus, thorough annotation and following the conventions are important for frictionless data processing. A) technology and technology_type (oem-key 6.1-2) B) for MiMo technologies the input and output energy vectors (oem-key 15.6.1.5.1-2) C) parameter names (oem-key 15.6.1.6.1-3) A) technology and technology_type The technology and technology_type columns from the oedatamodel-concrete are filled with the information from the subject key. B) input and output energy vectors for MiMo technologies The input and output energy vectors of technologies in SEDOS' reference energy system are defined in an external table. For technologies with multiple input and/or output energy vectors it is not clear to which energy vector a parameter column refers. To account for this the energy vector shall be annotated as a second concept in the isAbout key. For example: A CHP plant table entailing two efficiency columns - for the electrical and thermal efficiency. C) parameter names Case1 In cases where there is a single suitable ontology concept in the OEO we'll use the keys isAbout , valueReference as explained above. Case2 In cases where there are multiple ontology concepts in the OEO that are suitable by using them in composition we'll use them as list in the name key. For example: thermal efficiency of a heat power plant (as column in a tabular data set) The concept thermal efficiency is not (yet, as of 23.09.22) available in the OEO, but the concepts: 'heat generation process' http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/oeo-physical/OEO_00010248 'energy conversion efficiency' http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00140049 { \"resources\": [ { \"profile\": null, \"name\": null, \"path\": null, \"format\": null, \"encoding\": null, \"schema\": { \"fields\": [ { \"name\": \"thermal efficiency\", \"description\": \"The column holds the values of the thermal efficiency of a heat power plant\", \"type\": null, \"unit\": null, \"isAbout\": [ { \"name\": \"heat generation process\", \"path\": \"http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/oeo-physical/OEO_00010248\" }, { \"name\": \"energy conversion efficiency\", \"path\": \"http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00140049\" } ], \"valueReference\": [ { \"value\": null, \"name\": null, \"path\": null } ] } ] } } ] } todo: @JH-rli check with oemetadata builder functionalities Case3 In cases where there is NO suitable ontology concept in the OEO we'll copy the term used in the data directly to the name key for further data processing in SEDOS. Note This is SEDOS-specific and needed for data processing. Normally one would leave the annotation in isAbout empty. For example: fantasy power plant parameter { \"resources\": [ { \"profile\": null, \"name\": null, \"path\": null, \"format\": null, \"encoding\": null, \"schema\": { \"fields\": [ { \"name\": \"fantasy power plant paramter\", \"description\": \"The column holds values of a parameter, whose concept is not yet available in the OEO, of a fantasy power plant \", \"type\": null, \"unit\": null, \"isAbout\": [ { \"name\": \"fantasy power plant parameter\", \"path\": null } ], \"valueReference\": [ { \"value\": null, \"name\": null, \"path\": null } ] } ] } } ] } Link a parameter name to multiple related ontology concepts todo: decide on workflow, considering oemetadata builder yet limited functionality Via oemetadata builder todo: decide on workflow, considering oemetadata builder yet limited functionality ``","title":"Ontology"},{"location":"data_requirements/ontology/#ontological#annotation#of#data","text":"","title":"Ontological annotation of data"},{"location":"data_requirements/ontology/#basic#annotation#knowledge#with#oem","text":"Ontological annotation of data means that data is linked to ontological concepts in the metadata.

The following instructions will guide you through the process of contributing data in the SEDOS project. Hyperlinks direct you to more detailed information regarding the subject. How to contribute data? The following instructions will guide you through the process of contributing data in the SEDOS project. Hyperlinks direct you to more detailed information regarding the subject. 1. Create input data tables Collect and preprocess data into the tabular oedatamodel-parameter ( scalar or timeseries ) thereby following the input data conventions Store data sources in BIB-file and fill Bibtex-keys in \"source\"-column of the data table. Note timeseries data and scalar data are stored in two different tables 2. Create metadata Create the metadata according to the OEMetadata v.1.5.1 for each data table Use the scalar meta template and the timeseries meta template to build your metadata Use the oemetadata builder to create and edit your metadata -> copy scalar/timeseries meta template -> click on blue button \"Edit JSON\" -> click in opening window, with CTRL+A select all and paste scalar/timeseries meta template -> click \"save\" to confirm Fill in as many keys as possible, but at least the minimum required metadata information Annotate the keys subject , isAbout and/or valueReference with useful ontological concepts using the oemetadata builder -> go to the column you want to annotate -> click on blue button \"Add isAbout\" or \"Add Value reference\" or \"Add Subject\" -> click into the name line -> type in the concept you're looking for -> choose a suitable ontology concept from the dropdown menu -> click to confirm List all data sources in the form of Bibtex-keys under the sources key Add necessary license information to the sources according to the licensing guide todo @JH-rli: Will there be a save metadata button or does the user go back to the \"Edit JSON\" button to extract the metadata? 3. Initialize table on the OEP In order to add data to an OEP table, the (empty) table must be initialized on the OEP in the first place. In order to create the table, the resource from metadata is used, whereby the name of the resource is used to define the OEP schema and the table name (i.e. \"name\": \"model_draft.sedos_tech_wind_turbine\") and the fields from resource schema are used to create the related columns of the table. Initializing OEP table is done via: Visit oedatamodel-API Insert your OEP Username and Token Select metadata file to create OEP table from Submit 4. Publish datapackages The following step-by-step guide will show how to store data on the OEP and make it publicly available. As this guide is meant for developers of AP4-8, the oedatamodel-parameter will be used in the following. Prerequisite for publishing on OEP Data exists in oedatamodel-parameter format as CSV file Metadata exists with mandatory set of metadata information filled OEP user account Table has been created on OEP 4.1 Upload data to OEP with oedatamodel-API The oedatamodel-API uploads CSV files to the OEP. While uploading, incoming data is checked against metadata schema from related table. Thus, Prepare upload data in CSV file according to metadata in related table Then open the oedatamodel-API Insert your token, enter table name and schema (defaults to \"model_draft\") and select your CSV file Click Datei absenden to upload In case upload data contains errors (format, naming, etc.) an error report is returned. Otherwise, data is appended to given table on the OEP. 4.2 Release data on the databus The oedatamodel-API can also register your datapackages on the databus. Registering data on the databus must be done everytime, a new version of the data is available on the OEP. In order to register your new data you have to: Open the oedatamodel-API Enter your username and API Token Enter table name and schema (defaults to \"model_draft\") Enter new version string (at least one row in your table must be present with given string in column \"version\") Submit it. Now, your data should be registered and available on the databus. As the SEDOS pipeline regularly checks for updates on the databus, your new data version should be considered in next pipeline build. 5.
